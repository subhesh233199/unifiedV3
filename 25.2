TM-50622-- On further analysis by Kernel team, this is determined to be a duplicate of TM-50599. So, this ticket is closed and the resolution will be tracked under TM-50599.
TM-50599 --As per initial analysis, the issue is not replicating on Dev environment, but replicating on performance env. So, this is most likely a config/env issue.

Overall Open Issues: 31 	MEDIUM RISK	  TM-50700 - Multiple log files are generating on MW instance directory on ONEBOX VERIFY
This is a configuration issue. Correct configuration steps have been provided and the team have made the necessary changes on the environment. Ticket is in Verify status. PT team will monitor the issue for a few days and resolve the ticket. Priority is reduced to Medium by PT team
  TM-48989 - /Tmp directory getting full on All application servers IN PROGRESS
: This issue is related to a very specific (and probably rarely invoked) scenario. This happens in an offline storewalk, when User adds an image as a response from Mobility and the responses are uploaded to the server using a specific API(which is invoked only when the request content length is greater than some threshold). Based on this, team has requested PT team to reduce the priority to Medium. We will fix this ticket in 25.4 release
