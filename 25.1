Overall open  PT issues 	24	 
Summary	A major change in the 25.1 is java upgrade open JDK 21 
WSS socket time out session setting handle by code and system code properties
25.1 release, more ATL issues were observed, and more blockers were observed than 24.10. Pulse db CPU performance is a 10 to 15% increase in this build than the 24.10 (Intermittently observed)
Conducted 6hrs and 10hrs endurance tests to check for Memory/connection leak issues & System stability. The system is stable during the test.
So many log exceptions were observed and raised as BTL issues since there was no harm to the test
